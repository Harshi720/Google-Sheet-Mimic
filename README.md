**Assignment Name:** Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets

Features Containing:
**1.Spreadsheet Interface**
  Mimic Google Sheets UI: It is a layout with rows and columns, allow users to edit, select and format cells, include features for cell borders and background colors.
  Cell Dependencies: It refer to the relationships between cells in a spreadsheet where the value or formula in one cell relies on the value or formula in another.
  Support for basic cell formatting (bold, italics, font size, color).
  Ability to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.
  Drag Functions
  
**2. Performing Mathematical Functions** 
  The following mathematical functions are:
  *SUM: It is used to calculate the sum of range of cells
  (Syntax:=SUM(range)
  Example: =SUM(A1:A10))
  *AVERAGE: It is used to calculate the average of range of cells
  (Syntax: =AVERAGE(range)
  Example: =AVERAGE(A1:A10))
  *COUNT: It is used to calculate the count of range of cells
  (Syntax: =COUNT(range)
  Example: =COUNT(A1:A10))
  *MIN: It is used to calculate the minimum of range of cells
  (Syntax: =MIN(range)
  Example: =MIN(A1:A10))
  *MAX: It is used to calculate the maximum of range of cells
  (Syntax: =MAX(range)
  Example: =MAX(A1:A10))
  
**3. Data Quality Functions**
  *TRIM
  *UPPER
  *LOWER
  *REMOVE_DUPLICATES
  *FIND_AND_REPLACE

**4.Data Entry and Validation**
  It allows the users to give various datatypes like String, Numbers, Date.
  This validates the data as numeric cells only contain numbers.
  
**5.Testing**
  Testing provides the users to test the implemented functions with own data.
  This functional execution display results clearly.
  
** Bonus Features**
It has the additional/bonus features as uploading and downloading the functionality.
And it has the capabilities of data visualization int the form of
* Dot(.)Graph
* Plot Graph
* Line Graph
* Helping Features
